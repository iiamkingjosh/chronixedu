# CLAUDE.md — Chronix Edu agent rules

Read this before every task. It describes the system **as built** (September 2026).
Where the PDFs in `docs/spec/` disagree with this file, this file wins — see
"Spec drift" at the bottom. Audit history: `docs/AUDIT-2026-09.md`, `SECURITY.md`.

## What this is

Multi-tenant school management SaaS for Nigerian private schools. No real paying
client is live yet — every school currently in the database is either a test
fixture (created by an integration test, never cleaned up — see `L-test-data`
in `docs/AUDIT-2026-09.md`) or demo/sandbox data. `apps/api/scripts/seed-child-prime.js`
seeds a fictional "Child Prime Onyx School" with made-up Nigerian names and
gmail.com parent emails for demos/sales — it is NOT a real customer record, and
running it **wipes every school and every Supabase Auth user first**. Treat
this repo's "production" database as pre-launch: no real student, parent, or
payment data exists in it as of 18 Sep 2026. Monorepo, npm workspaces:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `apps/api` | Express + TypeScript. All business logic and all DB access. Railway. |
| `apps/web` | Next.js 14 App Router + Tailwind. Talks only to `apps/api`. Railway. |
| `migrations/` | Plain SQL, applied in filename order by `npm run migrate`. |
| `scripts/sql/` | Test stubs and one-off, reviewed operational SQL. |
| `docs/spec/` | Original PRD, architecture guide, agent file, build prompts, test plan (historical). |

## Non-negotiable doctrines

1. **Tenant id comes from the verified JWT, never the request.** Every
   `/api/schools/:schoolId/...` route runs `requireSchoolAccess`
   (`req.user.school_id === req.params.schoolId`, super_admin excepted) and
   filters every query by `school_id`. Never trust `school_id` in a body/query.
   ⚠️ **`requireSchoolAccess` is defined per route file and they are NOT identical.**
   Most files define the permissive version above; `routes/users.ts` defines one
   that admits **only super_admin and principal**. Read the definition in the file
   you are working in before concluding a route is or isn't guarded — a Round 10
   audit pass misreported an endpoint as world-readable by assuming the common
   version. When a route's access differs from its file's norm, add an explicit
   `requireRole(...)` so the intent is visible at the call site.
2. **RLS is defence in depth, not the enforcement layer.** The API's `pg` pool
   connects as the table owner and **bypasses RLS**. Isolation lives in route
   guards + `WHERE school_id = $n`. Every table still has RLS enabled (CI
   asserts it) so the Supabase REST endpoint exposes nothing.
3. **Validate the target, not just the caller.** A teacher assigned to a class
   may only write rows for students enrolled in that class for the term's
   session (`findStudentsNotInClass`). Components must belong to the resolved
   assessment config (`getAllowedComponentIds`).
4. **Scores are unique per `(student_id, subject_id, term_id, component_id)`.**
   Component ids are shared across subjects by class-level/default configs.
   Any score lookup or upsert without `subject_id` is a bug.
5. **Result workflow has two levels.**
   - `subject_result_status` (class + subject + term): `draft → submitted`.
     Teacher submit, score lock, principal return act here.
   - `result_status` (student + term): `draft → approved → published`.
     Approve requires every assigned subject submitted. Publish requires all approved.
   - `published` is final. Return moves approved → draft and submitted subjects → draft.
   - Guard every student-level change with `validateStatusTransition`.
   - **Parent- and student-facing score data requires `result_status === 'published'`.**
     Not `approved`, and not "a report card exists". The four routes that expose
     scores to those roles (`parent.ts` snapshot + results, `student.ts` dashboard +
     results) each gate on it explicitly; `computeClassResults` reads raw `scores`
     and applies no workflow filter of its own, so any new caller that serves a
     parent or student must apply the gate itself. Gating only the report-card PDF
     is not sufficient — that was the Round 10 H-01 defect.
6. **Every sensitive write is audited** (`logAudit`, or an `audit_logs` insert in
   the same transaction for batch writes): scores (old + new), result status,
   settings, payments, support-session actions. `audit_logs` has no DELETE.
7. **Money:** Postgres `numeric(12,2)` naira today. Never add/subtract money in
   JS floats — do arithmetic in SQL, or convert to integer kobo first. New money
   columns should be `bigint` kobo.
8. **Crons run through `runExclusive(name, fn)`** (Postgres advisory lock) and
   schedule with `{ timezone: CRON_TIMEZONE }` (Africa/Lagos). Any user-facing
   time-of-day logic on the server uses Africa/Lagos, not server time.
9. **The service role key never leaves the API** and is never logged, not even a prefix.

## Auth (as built)

- Login: Supabase `signInWithPassword` verifies the password; the API then signs
  its **own** HS256 JWT (`JWT_SECRET`, 1h) with `user_id, school_id, role, email,
  title, must_change_password, subscription_tier`. Supabase-issued tokens are
  not used anywhere else.
- Roles (`public.users.role`): `super_admin, principal, teacher, registrar, bursar, parent, student`.
- Middleware chain on `/api/schools`: `detectSupportSession → verifyToken →
  requirePasswordChanged → requireActiveSchool → router`. Routes additionally
  use `requireSchoolAccess` + `requireRole(...)`.
- Support sessions (impersonation) require the `x-support-session-id` header and
  a live `support_sessions` row. `ROOT_ADMIN_EMAIL` alone may manage other
  super_admins and wipe school data.
- Web stores the token in `localStorage` (`chronixedu_token`). `apiFetch`
  redirects to `/login` on 401 unless called with `deferAuthRedirect: true`,
  which throws `SessionExpiredError` so the caller can save unsaved work first.

## Conventions

- API response envelope: `{ success: true, data }` / `{ success: false, error: { code, message } }`.
  Status codes: 400 validation, 401 auth, 403 role/tenant, 404, 409 conflict/transition, 422 bulk validation, 423 locked.
- Validate every body/query with zod before touching the DB. Parameterised SQL only.
- DB access lives in `apps/api/src/db/queries/*`; routes orchestrate, services hold business logic.
- API logging via `logger` (winston). No `console.log` in app code.
- Web: all HTTP through `lib/api.ts` (`apiFetch`, `apiUpload`, `apiFetchBlob`). Forms use React Hook Form + zod.
  Offline score/attendance writes go through Dexie (`lib/offlineDb.ts`).
- Path alias `@/` in web. Keep files where their siblings are.
- Record security fixes in `SECURITY.md` (next round, existing format) and
  user-visible changes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, in the same PR as the change.
- New integration tests in `apps/api/tests/` must delete the rows they create in `afterAll`.

## Academic calendar

- A session has **at most 3 terms**, but onboarding only requires the one the school
  is starting in. Schools rarely know later term dates at sign-up and Nigerian
  calendars shift (holidays, strikes, elections), so the rest are added afterwards
  via `POST /:schoolId/sessions/:sessionId/terms`.
- **Term dates stay editable** via `PATCH /:schoolId/sessions/:sessionId/terms/:termId`
  (principal/super_admin, audited as `TERM_UPDATED`). `is_current` is deliberately not
  editable there — use the activate route, which maintains one-current-term-per-session.
- **Terms in a session must never overlap.** `findTermForDate()` resolves a date with
  `LIMIT 1` and no ordering, so an overlap makes attendance land in an arbitrary term.
  Both the add and edit routes reject overlaps with `409 TERM_DATE_CONFLICT`; onboarding
  applies the same rule through `validateTermRanges`.
- One current session per school and one current term per session are enforced by
  partial unique indexes from migration 001 (`one_current_session`, `one_current_term`).

## Migrations

- Next number after the highest in `migrations/`. Never edit an applied migration.
- Idempotent where possible (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`, find constraints by columns, not name —
  production constraints from 001–023 were partly applied by hand).
- Every new table: `school_id` (if tenant data), `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, a
  `service_role_bypass` policy and a tenant policy. `tenantIsolation.db.test.ts` fails otherwise.
- If code starts using a column, a migration must create it. CI rebuilds the schema from scratch.

## Definition of done

A change is done when all of these pass locally:

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc -p apps/api/tsconfig.json --noEmit
npx tsc -p apps/web/tsconfig.json --noEmit
npm run test:unit                       # mocked, no DB
npm run test:db                         # needs TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://…/chronixedu_test (local)
npm run test:integration:local          # same local DB; runs after test:db
(cd apps/web && npx next build)
```

Workflow/data-integrity changes need a DB test in `apps/api/src/__db_tests__/`
that **fails on the old code**. Never point any test at production: both test
setups refuse non-local hosts, and `ALLOW_REMOTE_TEST_DB=<host>` exists only for
a deliberate staging run.

| Hosting: Vercel (web) | Railway (web and api) |
| Firebase Cloud Messaging | Not used. In-app notifications (polled every 60s) + SendGrid + Termii |
| `packages/shared`, Axios, Zustand | Not present. Types live per app; `fetch` wrapper in `lib/api.ts` |
